Practical approach to the JAMstack and Serverless
architecture by building an simple blog with Pelican(static site generator) with content written in markdown combined with an serverless function written in python to
collect and send that review as an email using SMTP. Both the blog and serverless function are
being run locally with the help of pelican local server and azure function core tools.
